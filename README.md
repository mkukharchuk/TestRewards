# Rewards Page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to run the project:

##### 1. `git clone https://github.com/mkukharchuk/TestRewards.git`
##### 2. `cd TestRewards `
##### 3. `yarn install`
##### 4. `yarn start`

*Note: If you want you can also run mock server with command:*

##### `yarn server`

*Mock server has mocked data for 'rewards'. If case if server wasn't started or not working will be used data from mockData.ts file in project*

## Environment variables

In the application just used .env.development.example to speed up the setup.
In normal case real env files should be in .gitignore.

## Description

The project were build with create-react-app using typescript. For state management, I've chosen redux/toolkit because of its convenience and ease of use. For styles I've used styled-components. Dayjs were used for work with Date objects because it's a small and powerful package.
